Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[6][7]\n\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\n\nHistory\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[10][11]\n\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[12] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[13] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[12] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3719, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e473ddf-1e19-4837-b3e8-de2341d3a546": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e473ddf-1e19-4837-b3e8-de2341d3a546", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "00c050fe-19ae-4a34-b883-5f3f1922f9e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "0ff503d94421eb94a31bf2ed5b02f534651fea3c972e30acd2646b6ef5503ac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61b8d0a9-e310-4716-9a2b-3a59f65d231f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28b5a96fdb0bbc5a367ed87d351b55f7904d357654e9daca6e0f9e3203809d92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[12]\n\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17]\n\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[18] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19]\n\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20]\n\nRelationships to other fields\nArtificial intelligence\n\nMachine learning as subfield of AI[21]\nAs a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[22] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[23]:\u200a488\u200a\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]:\u200a488\u200a By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[24] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[23]:\u200a708\u2013710,\u200a755\u200a Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3719, "end_char_idx": 7443, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61b8d0a9-e310-4716-9a2b-3a59f65d231f": {"__data__": {"id_": "61b8d0a9-e310-4716-9a2b-3a59f65d231f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e473ddf-1e19-4837-b3e8-de2341d3a546", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "5d01f13d2b989bf24cf3498cb1ca563177e1aa1472ca845aa1d8e71ef4d852ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8d04e77-d17a-469b-9c91-ab1f11a931be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f63d14c554af59c6e3e010996cd581081ff1e02a5efb0546e4f8f6f71cda7f67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[23]:\u200a25\u200a\n\nMachine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.[24]\n\nData compression\nThis section is an excerpt from Data compression \u00a7 Machine learning.[edit]\nThere is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27]\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28]\n\nAccording to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n\nExamples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30]\n\nIn unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression.[31]\n\nData compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32]\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7362, "end_char_idx": 11120, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8d04e77-d17a-469b-9c91-ab1f11a931be": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8d04e77-d17a-469b-9c91-ab1f11a931be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61b8d0a9-e310-4716-9a2b-3a59f65d231f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "3c64e41beab8752fc70955c752173b49d32ef83002f5c8bc8b4ff924ddd6b79b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90afd26c-a7bf-43b0-b840-6b30ef2ab5e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bfa8703bf2729639f887e98202c069f51defd110550eed2acd18f5c4bd04079", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.[33][34]\nData mining\nMachine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[35]\n\nGeneralization\nCharacterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.\n\nStatistics\nMachine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.[36] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[37] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[37]\n\nConventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[38]\n\nLeo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[39] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.\n\nSome statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[40]\n\nStatistical physics\nAnalytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks.[41] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.[42]\n\nTheory\nMain articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory\nA core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[5][43] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11121, "end_char_idx": 15231, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90afd26c-a7bf-43b0-b840-6b30ef2ab5e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "90afd26c-a7bf-43b0-b840-6b30ef2ab5e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8d04e77-d17a-469b-9c91-ab1f11a931be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "1cd8cfadd696ac7d9def37f5fe154dd9c5395d50a10b0dcedf279e9c457ee0a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d346283-e37b-47cf-86d1-a90394ad26cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3814c590e04279af84046fcf2faaf47be42ed28780a0cf9506656128d4c3d646", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias\u2013variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[44]\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n\nApproaches\n\n\nIn supervised learning, the training data is labeled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabeled data.\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n\nSupervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\nUnsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\nReinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.[5]\nAlthough each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[45][46][47]\n\nSupervised learning\nMain article: Supervised learning\n\nA support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.\nSupervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[48] The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[49] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15232, "end_char_idx": 19345, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d346283-e37b-47cf-86d1-a90394ad26cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d346283-e37b-47cf-86d1-a90394ad26cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90afd26c-a7bf-43b0-b840-6b30ef2ab5e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "00287a6d35736f23fb6a2925340629b5153c81689a668def7e702f7962369277", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c96b85d-1896-436a-80d0-180a06e62346", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "96a2b031fc2ae483443ae4bb36536ba22d80361d7af6be09cecbbc817c4400b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[18]\n\nTypes of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[50] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature.[51]\n\nSimilarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\n\nUnsupervised learning\nMain article: Unsupervised learning\nSee also: Cluster analysis\nUnsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,[7] and density estimation.[52]\n\nCluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.\n\nA special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[53][54]\n\nSemi-supervised learning\nMain article: Semi-supervised learning\nSemi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.\n\nIn weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[55]\n\nReinforcement learning\nMain article: Reinforcement learning\n\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[56] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\n\nDimensionality reduction\nDimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[57] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19345, "end_char_idx": 23495, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c96b85d-1896-436a-80d0-180a06e62346": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c96b85d-1896-436a-80d0-180a06e62346", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d346283-e37b-47cf-86d1-a90394ad26cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "131fd8154f891c69d3132203eeae25801e194dad016e15518ff2ee452d1d8f86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9aa1da06-67f0-4f32-ab65-b9a0823eb1a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2a38b85ceea600e2558cae6cad5a8308c6d59131e516bb72acc25e01d638582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization.\n\nOther types\nOther approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modeling, meta-learning.[58]\n\nSelf-learning\nSelf-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[59][60] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n\nin situation s perform action a\nreceive a consequence situation s'\ncompute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s')\nupdate crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')\nIt is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62]\n\nFeature learning\nMain article: Feature learning\nSeveral learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[64] and various forms of clustering.[65][66][67]\n\nManifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.

It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69]\n\nFeature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n\nSparse dictionary learning\nMain article: Sparse dictionary learning\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.[70] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71]\n\nAnomaly detection\nMain article: Anomaly detection\nIn data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[72] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73]\n\nIn particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74]\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[75] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n\nRobot learning\nRobot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[76][77] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML).\n\nAssociation rules\nMain article: Association rule learning\nSee also: Inductive logic programming\nAssociation rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 27501, "end_char_idx": 31670, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0754a8ce-9648-4981-b27f-fc8f47315a8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0754a8ce-9648-4981-b27f-fc8f47315a8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9aa1da06-67f0-4f32-ab65-b9a0823eb1a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "fcf7ad00722d14715c71988ddaee397e137715c6eb92f56d18642ac96e1d2827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "85057850-1efc-41b1-b15d-8ce510fe1703", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c79958cc2d24c35ea45c0b1278202d37f10c120ba51ade3e82703569c88bc229", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[78]\n\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.\n\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[80] For example, the rule \n{\no\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\np\no\nt\na\nt\no\ne\ns\n}\n\u21d2\n{\nb\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\n}\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[81]\n\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.\n\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[82][83][84] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[85] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.\n\nModels\nA machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions.[86] By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 31671, "end_char_idx": 35647, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85057850-1efc-41b1-b15d-8ce510fe1703": {"__data__": {"id_": "85057850-1efc-41b1-b15d-8ce510fe1703", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0754a8ce-9648-4981-b27f-fc8f47315a8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "bc9e603d7fdd1ddf6e61e8664b158907f89c6bb72b7bec211eeabfdac11ad971", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f044861-ff38-4ade-8c63-4ce1c2e67e02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1d50ebf09a924fb836284030147a6520908b52efead811568ab2a5b7fccd8f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[87]\n\nVarious types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.\n\nArtificial neural networks\nMain article: Artificial neural network\nSee also: Deep learning\n\nAn artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\n\nDeep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88]\n\nDecision trees\nMain article: Decision tree learning\n\nA decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic\nDecision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\n\nRandom forest regression\nRandom forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models.  RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting.  To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data of from training set.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35647, "end_char_idx": 39851, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f044861-ff38-4ade-8c63-4ce1c2e67e02": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f044861-ff38-4ade-8c63-4ce1c2e67e02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85057850-1efc-41b1-b15d-8ce510fe1703", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "4923ff07b8ddc31a48930b2120eb42d3ee9fdd9566b6b6eb7b5816357a354a21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "583a16d8-8e86-487e-b559-6c0211fa93ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fea4de90ae57c8b7729470b08afa5f9e671bae603358be867a7c99368e573b4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve accuracy.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[91] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nRegression analysis\nMain article: Regression analysis\n\nIllustration of linear regression on a data set\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[92]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n\nMultivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,[93] which are inherently multi-dimensional.\n\nBayesian networks\nMain article: Bayesian network\n\nA simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.\nA Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.\n\nGaussian processes\nMain article: Gaussian processes\n\nAn example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models[94]\nA Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.\n\nGiven a set of observed points, or input\u2013output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.\n\nGaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39852, "end_char_idx": 44165, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583a16d8-8e86-487e-b559-6c0211fa93ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "583a16d8-8e86-487e-b559-6c0211fa93ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f044861-ff38-4ade-8c63-4ce1c2e67e02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "e54c22ecb184211df1a623c00c4618c4d08a7a740b7d68617ddc0b9509adfe37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ceb9fc1-29b9-47bf-90a2-00e1d0d5f3fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1ad42b25caa59466912e8a3fb130f53651580ed60c1d8cdb5ed24b6d50f950a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization.\n\nGenetic algorithms\nMain article: Genetic algorithm\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[95][96] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[97]\n\nBelief functions\nMain article: Dempster\u2013Shafer theory\nThe theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster\u2013Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach[clarification needed] would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[4][9] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\n\nTraining models\nTypically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\n\nFederated learning\nMain article: Federated learning\nFederated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.

A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[101] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[102] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[103] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[104] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[105] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[106] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[107] Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers.[108] Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone.[109][110][111] When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.[112]\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[113]\n\nMachine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters.

Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[123] The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[123]\n\nIn 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[124] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[125][126] Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[127]\n\nMachine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.[128]\n\nExplainability\nMain article: Explainable artificial intelligence\nExplainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[129] It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[130] By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\n\nOverfitting\nMain article: Overfitting\n\nThe blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise.\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[131]\n\nOther limitations and vulnerabilities\nLearners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[132] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[133][134]\n\nAdversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[135] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 51410, "end_char_idx": 55058, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ba4a917-937a-4fb1-ae3c-62540a41f5ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ba4a917-937a-4fb1-ae3c-62540a41f5ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba931848-56f1-44a3-8b06-ec5d53739b3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "bb83e3c0ad721cedb06abbe9f835a7e2711ad9a5890616aa15b93985eec6401c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ad2136a-b26c-4079-9916-2ba69c3386f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e312ab1f8bcbcc71c515a9b6d58322e9fde130ce949db76c807346a93c254d46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[135] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning.[136]\n\nResearchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.[137][138][139]\n\nModel assessments\nClassification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[140]\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.[141]\n\nEthics\nThis section is an excerpt from Ethics of artificial intelligence.[edit]\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.[142] This includes algorithmic biases, fairness,[143] automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks.[142]\n\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.\nBias\nMain article: Algorithmic bias\nDifferent machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[144]\n\nSystems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[145] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.[144] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[146][147] Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54947, "end_char_idx": 59047, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ad2136a-b26c-4079-9916-2ba69c3386f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ad2136a-b26c-4079-9916-2ba69c3386f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ba4a917-937a-4fb1-ae3c-62540a41f5ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "3204809f8d63fff1711bcc4b8952ce5da265b16a977282037f18581ea676b834", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f54469c-69d5-40f3-a6cd-5798541367c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36b6cf7709f36fec4dbd03775fa44b814685dc3956c9bb3056c91c5bd6b98b94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[148]\n\nWhile responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[149] In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, \"female faculty merely make up 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[150] Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[150]\n\nLanguage models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[151][152] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[153][154] In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[155]\n\nIn an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants\".[148] In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognize gorillas.[156] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[157]\n\nBecause of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[158] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who said that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and\u2014most importantly\u2014it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[159]\n\nFinancial incentives\nThere are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[160]\n\nHardware\nSince the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[161] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[162] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[163][164]\n\nNeuromorphic computing\nNeuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 59047, "end_char_idx": 62837, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f54469c-69d5-40f3-a6cd-5798541367c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f54469c-69d5-40f3-a6cd-5798541367c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ad2136a-b26c-4079-9916-2ba69c3386f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "3b7027ba7f919a985591edc72adafa5930807580a843324c5b53b647f371fb03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f166b52a-a385-4ef0-9515-95da0e4fe624", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6ba12952b5bb4707cd7c4a4b417b21a07b1c0a617c9cca55dde06b225cd0844", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialized hardware architectures.[165]\n\nphysical neural networks\nA physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses. The term \"physical neural network\" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.[166][167]\n\nEmbedded machine learning\nEmbedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers.[168][169][170][171] Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration,[172][173] approximate computing,[174] and model optimization.[175][176] Common optimization techniques include pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorization, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 62838, "end_char_idx": 64309, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f166b52a-a385-4ef0-9515-95da0e4fe624": {"__data__": {"id_": "f166b52a-a385-4ef0-9515-95da0e4fe624", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30e4f764-fd2c-423a-b57f-1e59913c6ce1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "704962f7df3d3065e53543b7428759c8af25cfc7ae63e079d73326c94f181b88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f54469c-69d5-40f3-a6cd-5798541367c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 106729, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "2c2aaa19b5f4906255de8180cc6d0c66ccdee6b7b75f48b6dce16cf44b2fc5c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c7cf299-3349-462e-b844-dc2dbec05912", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7773083fe15f8691e9613dbd583f24c9f0c67029527c7203d9d0c426f7a3f265", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Software\nSoftware suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:\n\nFree and open-source software\nCaffe\nDeeplearning4j\nDeepSpeed\nELKI\nGoogle JAX\nInfer.NET\nKeras\nKubeflow\nLightGBM\nMahout\nMallet\nMicrosoft Cognitive Toolkit\nML.NET\nmlpack\nMXNet\nOpenNN\nOrange\npandas (software)\nROOT (TMVA with ROOT)\nscikit-learn\nShogun\nSpark MLlib\nSystemML\nTensorFlow\nTorch / PyTorch\nWeka / MOA\nXGBoost\nYooreeka\nProprietary software with free and open-source editions\nKNIME\nRapidMiner\nProprietary software\nAmazon Machine Learning\nAngoss KnowledgeSTUDIO\nAzure Machine Learning\nIBM Watson Studio\nGoogle Cloud Vertex AI\nGoogle Prediction API\nIBM SPSS Modeler\nKXEN Modeler\nLIONsolver\nMathematica\nMATLAB\nNeural Designer\nNeuroSolutions\nOracle Data Mining\nOracle AI Platform Cloud Service\nPolyAnalyst\nRCASE\nSAS Enterprise Miner\nSequenceL\nSplunk\nSTATISTICA Data Miner\nJournals\nJournal of Machine Learning Research\nMachine Learning\nNature Machine Intelligence\nNeural Computation\nIEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence\nConferences\nAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\nAssociation for Computational Linguistics (ACL)\nEuropean Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)\nInternational Conference on Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (CIBB)\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)\nInternational Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)\nConference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)\nConference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)\nSee also\nAutomated machine learning \u2013 Process of automating the application of machine learning\nBig data \u2013 Extremely large or complex datasets\nDeep learning \u2014 branch of ML concerned with artificial neural networks\nDifferentiable programming \u2013 Programming paradigm\nList of datasets for machine-learning research\nM-theory (learning framework)\nMachine unlearning\nSolomonoff's theory of inductive inference \u2013 A mathematical theory\nReferences\n The definition \"without being explicitly programmed\" is often attributed to Arthur Samuel, who coined the term \"machine learning\" in 1959, but the phrase is not found verbatim in this publication, and may be a paraphrase that appeared later.

The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement, noted for nonviolent resistance, became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[61]\n\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.[62] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[64] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[65] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3715, "end_char_idx": 7126, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aded99c0-6bcd-4f13-ba3f-f211b49e1d25": {"__data__": {"id_": "aded99c0-6bcd-4f13-ba3f-f211b49e1d25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab48f24d-2a15-43c5-acc2-3058d55c05b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "a27a4874150b6d67f230d39e1aec7382747ca35614c0e927a2ecc5cacf67a130", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "977b4552-10fa-4779-a364-e99d1ee9ca38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82b82e64d926c0ad3d35ef234e22331eeeeece56d5ce9fb60e9c766c7ad4e932", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[69] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[71] is supported in protected habitats.\n\nEtymology\nMain article: Names for India\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1), ancient Greek Indos ( \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\n\nThe term Bharat (Bh\u0101rat; pronounced [\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0\u027e\u0259t] \u24d8), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\n\nHindustan ([\u0266\u026and\u028a\u02c8sta\u02d0n] \u24d8) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]\n\nHistory\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\nAncient India\n\nManuscript illustration, c.\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\u2009400 BCE \u2013 c.\u2009300 CE[82]\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500\u20131900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]\n\nDuring the period 2000\u2013500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7061, "end_char_idx": 10154, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "977b4552-10fa-4779-a364-e99d1ee9ca38": {"__data__": {"id_": "977b4552-10fa-4779-a364-e99d1ee9ca38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aded99c0-6bcd-4f13-ba3f-f211b49e1d25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "7202ce7dbea7673c4ab3e6e5e1b0474f6342f47a054a98901b48502b7493ffc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6eca2989-8c7f-4c13-9a42-b231babd8a2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9de516b0c2252963a0b4ccc680bb6e5846bc360ac090dcc1336c8418b79d35e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]\n\n\nCave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]\n\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108]\n\nMedieval India\nMain article: Medieval India\n\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010 CE\n\nThe Qutub Minar, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10154, "end_char_idx": 13517, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eca2989-8c7f-4c13-9a42-b231babd8a2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eca2989-8c7f-4c13-9a42-b231babd8a2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "977b4552-10fa-4779-a364-e99d1ee9ca38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "527ff764878fee56199b92fae5d4caca318e41e04fd2c6ec46ad7fb953e55d47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6954db6c-9cea-4e1c-ba67-fc912e1e8393", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34370f08b83c17a972607a2b71f9c5682d3179c9cf49fa9d9fc3ddb611f16491", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]\n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]\n\nEarly modern India\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule.

and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[134] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[140]\n\nModern India\nMain article: History of India (1947\u2013present)\nHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes\u2014among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]\n\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18142, "end_char_idx": 21821, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef7a2a6-4489-4412-814c-4e1a3b2671e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef7a2a6-4489-4412-814c-4e1a3b2671e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "565feb29-9ce5-4be7-b9ec-8c782444e86b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "5c0900575b93537ded58e658d3ced9301f7f9840c39b4cbf5526e982a8fb5488", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27244198-63df-4e58-ad9e-c0f6bc959fbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3abdbac8e73783748fd5cf00c8258cd278a5ac02fab373314eff94a24e474320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1909 map of the British Indian Empire\n\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began.

The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[241] originally stated India to be a \"democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to a \"socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[242] India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]\n\nThe Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers\u2014with the cabinet being its executive committee\u2014headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[252]\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[251] The Lok Sabha's 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[256] The Indian constitution historically allowed for the nomination of Anglo-Indians to two seats in the Lok Sabha; this provision was removed in 2019.[255][257] A number of seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]\n\nIndia has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[258] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[258] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[259] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[260] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[261]\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\nSee also: Political integration of India\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system.

The two have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh.[268] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[269]\n\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[270] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[271] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[272] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[273][274]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41577, "end_char_idx": 44511, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50f7687a-5f37-4b92-b1f8-f9ac3272b0dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "50f7687a-5f37-4b92-b1f8-f9ac3272b0dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a04e9c6-33cf-4e21-b347-cec7be9afc8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f3c6ea16eab5e14879a27f650261c5cd63b1af962c9fb3fa898448af71966d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd8cea93-403c-47c8-928f-0079d26761e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7f2e1fd460308a6f530a66bd683bd2d199d4f8a597ba01bc6ddd3651c0403b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009.

Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[277] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[278][279] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[280][281] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[282]\n\nIndia is estimated to possess up to 172 nuclear warheads, and is considered to be producing both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, with its HEU production assumed to be focused on its growing number of nuclear-powered vessels' and submarines' fuels.[283][284] Kristensen et al. of Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists estimate that India is operating eight nuclear-capable systems as of 2024, including aircraft, land-based and sea-based ballistic missile systems, with most of its programs in development thought to be nearing \"completion and to be fielded with the armed forces soon\".[283]\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[285] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[286] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[287] France,[288] the United Kingdom,[289] and Canada.[290]\n\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the world's second-largest military.

In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[382][383][384] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[385] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 60591, "end_char_idx": 63861, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27f7c0af-c83b-4711-94b2-b587502537e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "27f7c0af-c83b-4711-94b2-b587502537e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32fde552-49a0-4f6c-a5dd-0c7a05b58537", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "96cc66e7c94c843c2668f2649c0b3d0a8e6317afc74f88db61e77254e94d5943", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36fc6df1-ca6d-4f29-a3c9-ad249eb1c3b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dabe91af61abfb00c9fac381ebff20b78e6659658b7cce165d42e5239767d6a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[386][387] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[388][389]\n\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[390] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[391][392] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[393] Gupta art, at its peak c.\u2009300 CE \u2013 c.\u2009500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[394][395] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\u2009800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[396] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[397][398]\n\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[399][400] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain.

Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[427] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama.

It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end\u2014passing over the shoulder\u2014covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body's contours.[460] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[461]\n\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.\u20091300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.\u20091525 CE).[462] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[462] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[462]\n\n\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\nSalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[463] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[464] its side seams left open below the waistline.[465] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees.[466]\n\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[467] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[467] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[467] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[467] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[468] is seldom seen in the cities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76193, "end_char_idx": 79306, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d38f9624-6ac9-4321-8720-7138cfb62e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "d38f9624-6ac9-4321-8720-7138cfb62e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6a069b8-fc6d-41bb-8470-aaaa39043ade", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "4def19c71a684a454d1c5c74bb0cfb0c02617d5b29f14b3d2068e7f49f316390", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f45475c-dd8c-4fc1-b849-4679418ce45c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d99c52fa511c0d62e6705e7436633897efdb7180f3159e0cd011d20c83219dc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[467]\n\nCuisine\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\n\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[469] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[470] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake.[471] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[469] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[472]\n\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing\u2014for example of rice and lentils\u2014or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping\u2014such as chapati and cooked vegetables.[469]\n\nDuration: 14 seconds.0:14\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[473]\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[474] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[474] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[475] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[476]\n\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[477] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[478] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[479] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[479] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[479] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[480] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine.

Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose\u2014a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'\u2014was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features\u2014probably including some surviving Harappan influences\u2014that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people\u2014especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics\u2014are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent.

Gods like Visnu and Siva (under the name Rudra), who will become so dominant later, are already present in the Rgveda, though in roles both lesser than and different from those they will later play, and the principal Rgvedic gods like Indra remain in later Hinduism, though in diminished capacity (p. 4).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 97335, "end_char_idx": 100665, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d8fc55c-702e-47ec-b9d0-e55f19434272": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d8fc55c-702e-47ec-b9d0-e55f19434272", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6666cdb-f285-49f5-9ed0-f57329755a3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "8f8bc3c689048f7b5fad89eee314072c055d27bbfda3201f3761dd9282c89a9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87d86632-8252-4319-97c9-b0683ee8bb24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/manishsingh/Documents/genAi/chatwitthdoc/Data/data2.txt", "file_name": "data2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 179135, "creation_date": "2025-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-15"}, "hash": "cef841009021b681a6a3210db5aea0fcab3860543b5b9dac77aec881cf811600", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a132757-03d4-4c38-89a1-5f1073c6fa2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "129d0288e726ef1fa2b07a145b232ffa02885c23d8faa54aa455e416edd1ba69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "4).;\n(b) Flood, Gavin (2020), \"Introduction\", in Gavin Flood (ed.), The Oxford History of Hinduism: Hindu Practice: Hindu Practice, Oxford University Press, pp. 4\u2013, ISBN 978-0-19-105322-1, I take the term 'Hinduism to meaningfully denote a range and history of practice characterised by a number of features, particularly reference to Vedic textual and sacrificial origins, belonging to endogamous social units (jati/varna), participating in practices that involve making an offering to a deity and receiving a blessing (puja), and a first-level cultural polytheism (although many Hindus adhere to a second-level monotheism in which many gods are regarded as emanations or manifestations of the one, supreme being).;\n(c) Michaels, Axel (2017).

Almost all traditional Hindu families observe until today at least three samskaras (initiation, marriage, and death ritual). Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although samskaras vary from region to region, from class (varna) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the Brahmin priests.

She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\n Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009), The Partition of India, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-85661-4, archived from the original on 13 December 2016, retrieved 15 November 2015, When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ...

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards.

The term Hindu originated as a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Later, Hindu was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who lived across the Indus River. This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term Hind\u016b, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the \"land of Hindus.\"\n \"Hindustan\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, retrieved 17 July 2011\n Lowe, John J.
